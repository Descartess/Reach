## Reach

This is a developer productivity tool that allows developers post queries to multiple Q$A platforms in a single post and then return all responses from to a single end point


#### Problem Statement
What problem is this project trying to solve. Imagine a scenario where you as a developer hit a bug or have a question you want to share with other developers. 

Currently this how one would approach the problem.
1. Write up the query and then post it to all the desired developer community group say stackexchange exchange sites, Reddit , Dev.to to mention but a few 
2. Then the developer would then have to keep checking each of the individual developer community platforms for responses.

Personally I believe this is a waste of time and this entire process can be automated

This project aims to automate this entire process 
#### Technologies to be Used

1. GraphQL
2. Javascript


NB. This project is still a work in progress
